I started making websites about video games and manga when I was 11, like [anime-story.com](http://www.anime-story.com) *(also known as mymanga.io)*, which ended up getting 30k visitors/day and paid for itself for years. After 42, I did 6 years at Powens doing banking APIs and reverse-engineering websites and apps, then 4 years at Partoo as lead dev. These days I mostly build stuff with Claude Code and automate things that annoy me.
